        <p>Last year, nearly 2 million acres were devastated by the
             deadliest, most destructive wildfires in California history.

        <h1>Stuck in the middle.</h1>
        <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, 
            our design team reimagined the California Grizzly and used 
            it to create custom tees, pins and posters.
        </p>
          <p>Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters 
              will be available for purchase at our exclusive pop-up
               shop during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday,
                June 21. You can choose what amount to donate. All proceeds
                 will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities 
                 that are still displaced.

    <h3>The Golden Bear </h3>
      <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome 
        difficult situations and come out stronger than before. It’s a 
        flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the 
        California poppy.

  <h1>The Poppy Bear </h1>
  <p>This design is inspired by the quote ‘grow through what you go 
    through’ and represents the strength of Californians and how we
     will continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
